## What kind of people I am trying to be?
I believe it is important to be:
* __Responsible__.
  - I should take care of any of my duties and play well every role that I need to be. I never complain of and escape from what I should do. As a student, I know that I should work hard on every course. As a Ph.D., I know that I should read existing literature and do creative researches. As a son, I know that I need to respect any expectations for me from my parents, although I do not always follow all of them because parents also make mistakes. As a friend, I know that I should help others to the best of my ability and be reliable for everything that my friend asked me to do. As a reviewer, I know that I should review every subission qucikly without delays and provide detailed and well-justified comments. 
  - If you asked me to do something and I agreed, then you can go back to bed and sleep because I am reliable. (But please allow me to refuse your request if it is _extremely_ inconvenient for me.)
  - I reply to every message (WeChat, Email, etc.) soon after I see it. I do everything as quickly as I can if I am supposed to be.
* __Sincere__.
  - I understand that it might be "clever" and "emotionally intelligent" to close mouth, to hedge, to wait and see, and/or to play tricks. But this is not my perference. I prefer to tell everyone what I am really thinking because this would be helpful for others to take their optimal actions. I seldom hedge; I would tell people what are my expectations and concerns, and why I can/cannot do something this time.
* __Kind__.
  - As a human, I know that I should respect everyone no matter who he/she is. Humans are not machines: we have emotions. I respect every personal style and personal opinion as long as it is in the line of laws, rules, and policies. I never intentionally embarrass, trouble, and/or do harm to others. 
  - Please feel free to refuse me if you think what I am asking for is not convenient for you: I never mind this because everyone has his/her personal concerns.
* __Helpful__.
  - It is a virtue to help others without asking for bonuses. Bring hopes to others is also beneficence.
* __Clever__.
  - It is always important to quickly understand what happened and other people's concerns, styles, opinions, cultures, etc. This is because only when we have good understandings about what happened in the past can we take optimal actions (or say best words) for the future; Only when we have good understandings about others can we appropriately respect and get along well with them.
  - Do not try to play tricks with me because I can quickly find it, although I do not always let you know. But this may let me have some (bad) labels on you in my mind, although you may never know them. The more such labels you have, the farther we are.
  - I am not an opinionated and stubborn person and I am open to hear critiques, comments, and suggestions. I am happy to change myself everyday. But I change myself only when I can realize that I am wrong: I do not directly follow other people's instructions even though he/she is a renowned person. In my understanding, "you are right and I have a different opinion from you" does not necessarily imply that "I am wrong".
    + Therefore, please explain your opinions and concerns to me before I get your points.
