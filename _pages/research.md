## Publication Topics
<p align="justify">
My up-to-now publication topics include statistical signal processing (e.g., optimal estimation theory, time series analysis, and target tracking), statistical machine learning (e.g., generalization error theory), and intelligent transportation. 
</p>

## Research Topics
<p align="justify">
I am quite interested in probabilistic, statistical, and optimization theories. My research interests and theoretical backgrounds include statistics and optimization theories with applications in signal processing, machine learning, and control theory. Specifically, I am interested in and familiar with the following areas:
</p>

* Frequentist and Bayesian Statistics
* General Optimization Theory
* Stachastic Programming
* Distributionally Robust Optimization
* State Estimation and Filtering Theory
* Time Series Analysis
* Linear and Nonlinear System, and Hidden Markov Process
* Control Theory and Application, Navigation and Guidance, and Reinforcement Learning
* Target Positioning and Tracking
* Instrumentation and Measurement Systems

## Academic Activities
<p align="justify">
I am an active reviewer for IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing and IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement. I also occasionally reviewed papers for IEEE Signal Processing Letters, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems, and IISE Transactions. I never delayed the review process. All my review comments have been returned within the first two weeks after I received the invitations. Also, all my comments are quite detailed and well justified.
