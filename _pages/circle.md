  * [Prof. Vincent Tan](https://vyftan.github.io/) (My postdoctoral advisor)
    + This is a kind, responsible, passionate, considerate, flexible, helpful, respectful, and knowledgeable professor. I can find every virtue that a professor is supposed to have. It is my fortune to work with him. His cares for students and postdoctoral members are unconditional. He taught me how to write proper mathematics such as how to structure a paper, how to normalize the notation system, how to deliver a satisfactory presentation, and how to strictly follow academic ethics (e.g., when to or not to coauthor a paper).
  * [Prof. Xiaobo Li](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/isem/staff/li-xiaobo/) (My Ph.D. thesis advisory committee member)
    + Xiaobo is also a kind, responsible, considerate, helpful, respectful, unselfish, and knowledgeable professor. He helped me a lot in structuring, formalizing, and clarifying my Ph.D. thesis; The presentation and scientific qualities of my thesis were improved a lot under his advice. I feel extremely warm and respected everytime when I talk with him: He is trying to encourage and bring hopes to me (and, I believe, all his students) in his every word.
  * [Prof. Jianhua He](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/en/j82zf0vfmf50835d3461429868736702.html) (My master's thesis advisor)
    + Prof. He is also very nice and respectful. He cares about students to his best. He encouraged me to do a Ph.D.: Without his encouragement, I am certainly not a Ph.D. now.
  * [Prof. Haobin Shi](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/en/shihaobin.html) (My undergraduate contest advisor)
    + Prof. Shi is also very nice and respectful. He also cares about students to his best. Under his advice, I participated in several robot contests during which my programming and mathematical skills have been deeply trained and substantially improved.
