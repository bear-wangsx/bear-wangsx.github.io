## Trusted Panel
__If one of the following professors says that I am wrong (in any sense), then with high probability I am wrong, although sometimes I cannot quickly fully get their points; However, I would seriously consider their comments and suggestions because their cares for me are unconditional and their comments on me are objective__:
